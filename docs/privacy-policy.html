  <h1>Privacy Policy — Skip Wait</h1>
  <p>Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Skip Wait is a browser extension that helps you skip countdown timers and waiting pages on supported link shorteners and file hosts. This policy describes what data the extension uses and does not use.</p>

  <h2>Data collection</h2>
  <p>Skip Wait does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data or personally identifiable information. We do not run analytics, track users, or maintain user accounts.</p>

  <h2>Network requests</h2>
  <p>The extension fetches a public configuration file from Pastebin (a third-party service) to know which sites and scripts to apply. This request does not include any user identifiers or personal data. Content scripts may run on and interact with third-party sites (e.g. link shorteners); any cookies or local storage on those sites are governed by those sites’ own policies, not by Skip Wait.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>We use Chrome’s <code>scripting</code> and <code>host_permissions</code> only to inject content scripts on the domains defined in the config, so the extension can modify waiting pages. We do not use these permissions to read your browsing history, log URLs, or send your data elsewhere.</p>

  <h2>Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not share or sell any user data because we do not collect any.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>If this policy changes, we will update the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
